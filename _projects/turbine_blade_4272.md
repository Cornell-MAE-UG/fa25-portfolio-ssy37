We designed a wind turbine blade with the objective of maximizing turbine power extraction over a wide range of wind speeds. Our blade is 6 inches long and uses a NACA 4415 airfoil cross-section. The pitch was designed to maintain the optimal angle of attack of 9 degrees along the entire blade length. The chord was optimized to maximize rotary force and keep bending stress to a minimum.
