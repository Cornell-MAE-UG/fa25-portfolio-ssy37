The Boeing 737 MAX incident shows how safety failures are not just caused by technical incompetency, but also by a combination of organizational, regulatory, and ethical issues. A central problem was the lack of transparency surrounding the MCAS system. Pilots were not adequately informed or trained on the system, which limited their ability to recognize and respond to unsafe behavior. This decision was driven largely by business priorities—specifically, Boeing’s desire to avoid costly retraining requirements and remain competitive. In this case, financial and schedule pressures were allowed to override the ethical obligation to prioritize public safety, violating the principle that safety should always come before cost or reputation.

The incident also revealed deeper issues within both Boeing and the FAA. There was a lack of oversight and questionable accountability since Boeing and FAA officials had very close ties with each other. Internally, engineers faced cultural and organizational barriers that discouraged raising safety concerns, including fear of retaliation and lack of legal protection for whistleblowers. Business and finance leaders were able to exert significant influence over engineering decisions despite lacking technical expertise, further increasing risk. Together, these factors created an environment where minimum regulatory compliance was treated as sufficient, even though it isn't necessarily ethical. The 737 MAX case demonstrates the need for stronger protections for engineers, clearer separation between business and engineering authority, improved regulatory independence, and an unwavering commitment to public safety as the top priority in engineering practice.
